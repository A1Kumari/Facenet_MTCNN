<h1>Face Recognition TF</h1>
- Used MTCNN and VGG-Face2 to implement a siamease neural network like architehture for extracting face embeddings.<br>
- Created a Pinecone database to store embeddings of faces.<br>
- New Image embeddings are queried from the database on basis of cosine similarity.<br>
- Created a streamlit app to facilitate interactivity with the project.<br><br>
